== OpenShift Application Migration Lab

=== Migrating Applications from OCP/OCS 3 to OCP/OCS 4

This guide will provide you with hands-on exposure to the OpenShift Migration Tooling through a series of exercises migrating application workloads (both stateful and stateless) between OpenShift Clusters.

=== Goals

In this instructor-led, hands-on lab, youâ€™ll experience:

* Migrating applications from Red Hat OpenShift 3 clusters to Red Hat OpenShift 4 clusters using the Cluster Application Migration Tool (CAM) provided by OpenShift Container Platform 4.3.
* Use cases that migrate applications preserving state, including how to migrate OpenShift Container Storage 3 (Gluster) to OpenShift Container Storage 4 (Ceph).
