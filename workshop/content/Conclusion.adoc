*Congratulations* and *Thank You* for participating in the OpenShift Application Migration Lab. We hope you have found it to be both informative and thorough. By now you have completed the following activities:

* Familiarized yourself with the CAM WebUI
* Migrated multiple applications (stateless and stateful) from OpenShift 3 to OpenShift 4
* Performed both Copy and Move operations for handling Persistent Volumes
* Leveraged the API to migrate multiple namespaces in a single Migration Plan

Weâ€™ve included a couple of additional applications in the 3.11 cluster deployment (Parks App & Robot Shop). Feel Free to perform migrations of these applications too (time permitting).
